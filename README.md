## Frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game

This is my submision of Project: Classic Arcade Game Clone a part of the Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree Program.

It contain several folders with css, html and js files. UDACITY provided visual assets and a game loop engine, [sourse code can be found here](https://github.com/udacity/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game).

Using these tools I added a number of entities to the game including the player characters and enemies to recreate the classic arcade game Frogger.

HOW TO RUN: Download `.zip` file, extract it and open `index.html` in your browser.

HOW TO PLAY: You can move player up, down, left and right with arrow keys; if player reach the water - you win 10 points, if bug collide with the player, you lost a point.
